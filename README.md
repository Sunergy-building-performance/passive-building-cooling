### 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a *defensive technical disclosure* to establish
a publicly verifiable timestamp for the conceptual principles described herein.

The disclosure is published following the filing of a corresponding patent application and is intended solely for:
- Prior art documentation
- Conceptual and technical reference
- Defensive publication purposes

---

### 🛡 Intellectual Property Notice

The technical concepts disclosed in this repository are subject to
prior filing rights and priority claims.

Certain implementations of the disclosed concepts may fall within the scope
of existing or pending intellectual property rights under applicable laws.

No license, express or implied, is granted by this disclosure.

### 🧭 Scope of Disclosure

This repository discloses:
- System-level conceptual logic
- Physical and environmental principles
- Functional relationships between system components

This repository *does NOT disclose*:
- Construction drawings
- Exact dimensions or material specifications
- Installation procedures
- Industrial implementation details

---

### 📐 Performance Context Clarification

Any references to system performance, effectiveness, or environmental outcomes
(e.g., cooling impact, humidity control, condensation mitigation)
are discussed strictly within the context of a verified implementation framework.

Such outcomes are not inherent to the disclosed concepts alone and
cannot be assumed to arise from partial, unverified, or non-compliant applications.

No performance claims are made or implied outside the verified framework.

---

### 🌱 Technical Background (High-Level)

The disclosed system explores passive cooling mechanisms
applicable to hot-humid climatic conditions,
leveraging interactions between:
- Heat
- Airflow
- Water
- Shading elements

The intent is to demonstrate *conceptual feasibility*
rather than executable instruction.
